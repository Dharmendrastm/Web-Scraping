# 🕸️ What is Web Scraping?

In simple terms, **web scraping** is the process of automatically extracting data from websites.

It includes:
- **Fetching** the HTML content of a webpage
- **Parsing** the HTML to locate the desired information
- **Extracting** and **processing** that data for use

---

### 💬 What Does an HTTP Response Contain?
When you send a request to a website, the server responds with:
- ✅ **Status Code** (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
- 📄 **HTML content** (used by browsers to render the page)
- 📁 **Multimedia files**, cookies, headers, and metadata

---

# 🧭 Main Steps in Web Scraping

### ✅ 1. Send an HTTP Request (using Python)
### ✅ 2. Extract the useful content from HTML
### ✅ 3. Process and store the data (in file/DB/CSV)

---

# 🔍 Detailed Steps

1. **Fetch HTML** – Get the page content using HTTP request  
2. **Parse HTML** – Use a parser like BeautifulSoup to read it  
3. **Extract Data** – Find and extract needed parts (tags, classes)  
4. **Store Data** – Save it in a usable format (CSV, JSON, DB)

---

# ✅ Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of **Python**
- Understanding of **HTML structure** (tags, classes, IDs)

---

# 🛠️ Required Tools

1. Python (any version 3.x)
2. PIP (Python package installer) to install libraries like:
   - `requests`
   - `beautifulsoup4`

---

# 📜 Web Scraping Rules

1. Always follow the website’s **Terms & Conditions**
2. Don’t overload the server with **too many requests**
3. Your code may **break** if the website structure changes

---

# 🔁 `requests` Module

- Sends HTTP requests to a server and gets back the response.
- Requires just the **URL** of the target webpage.

### 📌 Syntax:
```python
requests.get(URL)
```

### ✅ Example:
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("http://books.toscrape.com/")
print(response)  # Output: <Response [200]>
```

---

# 🧠 HTTP Methods:

### ✅ **GET Request**
- Used to **retrieve** data from a webpage.
- Example: Getting live cricket score.

### ✅ **POST Request**
- Used to **send** data to the server (e.g., login form submission).

---

# 🧪 Using BeautifulSoup

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
```

### 📌 Key Attributes:

| Attribute         | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `headers`         | Shows response headers               |
| `status_code`     | Shows status of HTTP response        |
| `url`             | URL used for the request             |
| `cookies`         | Cookies sent by the server           |
| `elapsed`         | Time taken for the request-response  |
| `prettify()`      | Formats and prints HTML content nicely |

# 🔧 Python Libraries for Web Scraping (Basic to Advanced)

| Library            | Purpose                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `requests`         | Fetch HTML content                        |
| `beautifulsoup4`   | Parse and extract data from HTML          |
| `lxml`             | Fast parser (alternative for bs4)         |
| `csv`              | Save data to CSV                          |
| `pandas`           | Handle and clean data (advanced)          |
| `scrapy`           | Large scale scraping framework            |
| `selenium`         | Scrape JavaScript-heavy pages             |
| `fake_useragent`   | Add fake user-agent headers               |
| `time` / `random`  | Add delay between requests                |

---

## 💡 Recommended for Beginners:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

Use built-in `csv` to save data:
```python
import csv
```
